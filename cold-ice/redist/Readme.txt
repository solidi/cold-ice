---Description---
Cold Ice is a Half-Life Deathmatch that changes all the weapons from the regular DM and replaces these with totally new weapons to make the game more enjoyable. It includes first ever (for HL DM) "Smart Hud Notification System" in which the client of the HEV is updated with all activities of his or her own weapons, deaths, other players, items and scoring points.
Cold Ice includes a voice identification system witch both plays a wav file and displays text to its client on the hud.

This MOD is not server sided. You have to have the newest client dll inorder to join  a Ice server.
                                                                                     (Which comes included)


---Installation---
Simply Click on the exe file and it will guide you through the installation process.

---Key Binding---
There are currently 6 commands
1) +hook -  This command lets you throw a grapple hook.
2) weaponmenu - Displays weapon selection
3) ammomenu - Displays ammo selection
4) addbot - add a bot to your server.
5) mp_bots - bots on or off
6) mp_hook - grapple on or off

---How to play Cold Ice---
Its pretty simple. Everyone who joins a cold ice server and starts off with 0 frags. As you frag away with your trusty manual weapon
you can trade in your hard earned frags for some kick ass weapons. You can always buy ammo for a cheap price.

Both of these menu can be actived by the commands   ammomenu  and   weaponmenu

Why did we change the rules?
This was because we wanted to cut lagg. This mode inturn  makes smooth gameplay because the server doesnt have to serve all the world models + the serious expolsives.
Also, it gives a chance for the little guy to actually win. A good player will conserve frags inorder to gain the biggest weapons!
But be careful. Dont be a slacky if you have the nuke launcher. People can still kill you.. and they could take away your hard earned weapon!

Dont be a llama! The railgun is probably the best weapon cold ice has to offer. I would USE IT!

---Version Confliction---
If you get a message "Wrong DLL" or "Missing DLL", most likely you joined a earlier or newer version of Cold Ice on a server.

---Missing DLL APTI---
This Means the dll and cl_dll  is located in the wrong directory. 
The DLL should always be placed in the C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\ICE\dlls directory.
The CL_DLL should always be placed in the  C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\ICE\cl_dlls directory.

---Known Buggs---
-A certain command while typed in observer mode will crash the server ( Im not telling you )
