Cold-Ice Resurrection is a modification for the game, Half-Life.
Its idea is based on the old modification for Half-Life called
Cold-Ice. It is a extreme deathmath modification for those who
are sick and tried of realistic teamplay. Cold-Ice offers many 
new features to deathmatch not seen before. Such as the totally
new damage system. Instead of a general health count, Cold-Ice
takes it one step further and offers a multi-part damage system.
Cold-Ice offers many new weapons to kill with. Including many
explosive, high damage weapons. Even some weapons may also affect
its user such as an explosive sharpnel or explosion.

<hr align="left" color="#000000" width="60">
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cold-Ice Resurrection is very easy to install. When you finish downloading
the installation file from the internet (no, you didn't pay for this, did you?),
double click on the installation file to begin. If you didn't install
Half-Life in the default directory, make sure the root directory ponts
to the half-life/ folder. After it finished, and it didn't expereince any
problems, Boot up Half-Life and choose the custom games submenu, you should see 
"Cold-Ice Resurrection" in the window. This confirms that you have completed the
simple task.  Cold-Ice Resurrection is ready to go!

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Getting started with Cold-Ice Resurrection is rather simple and easy to the
advid Half-Life player. After installation, boot up Half-Life with a 
shortcut -game cir so that Half-Life begins in CIR mode. If you do not
know how to do this, you can simply enable Cold-Ice Resurrection by booting Half-Life 
and selecting CIR through the custom game menu. After this is completed, you 
must bind the controls through the controls menu section. There are new binds
and changes from the standard HLDM, so please take the time to bind! Lastly,
go into the customize submenu and select certain new optins and also 
change the default name to one of your own. And lets not forget about the new
player models! Once all this is completed, its your job to find a CIR server 
and start a holy war!

<a name="#weapons"></a><b>The Weapons</b><br>
<hr align="left" color="#000000" width="60">
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cold-Ice Resurrection has a wide assortment of weapons at your
disposal. All have their pros and cons and should be used wisely.
The key to win is in the usage of the weapon. The weapons are assorted by
melee, handguns, machineguns & rifles, explosive and handthrown. They are:<br><br>
<a name="#melee"></a><b>Melee</b><br><br>
<i>Steel Pipe</i> - This weapon is used when you are fighting at close
combat with your enemy. If it is needed, the steelpipe can get
the job done. Its very strong but it opens you for easy attack
of any other weapon class, especially rifles. The steelpipe
should be used only when you either out of ammo or when you
see a disabled victim. Smack their brains out!<br><br>
<a name="#pistols"></a><b>Handguns</b><br><br>
<i>9mm Pistol</i> - The simplest in handgun's 101. Its a pistol and it
fires a 9mm bullet. It has stopping power if your good with
the gun. When it comes down to speed and accuracy, look for
no other. Do not under estimate its power, the pistol destroys
the ignorant.<br><br>
<a name="#machineguns"></a><b>Machine Guns & Rifles</b><br><br>
<i>9mm Sub Machine Gun</i> - Firing 30 bullets within 3 seconds, when
it comes down to mass killing, this is the one for you. Its
stopping power is great but only when used wisely. Do not get
to comfortable with this tool, you will go through loads of 
rounds within seconds and burn a hole in you reserve. Note:
Second fire selects different fire modes for each situtation
at hand. Full-auto, burst and semi-atuo.<br><br>
<i>12g Slug Rifle</i> - Commonly known as a "shotgun", this bad boy
has the "not so marksman" accuracy to stop many men at a time.
Although its pellets do not hurt as much as some of the other
guns, its focus is on quanity. Blast away at close range and
its all over for the enemy. Blast away at far range and its
pretty much useless. The key to master this weapon is in
the timing.<br><br>
<i>5.56mm Machine Gun</i> - Automatic at its best, this baby
fires 5.56mm rounds that pirece through walls and hurt the
enemy to the fullest. The rifle also has a scope for those
zoom in kills. Although it is slower than the 9mm sub machine 
gun, it will always get the job done. The scope zooms in 50m.<br><br>
<i>7.62 Blaser Rifle</i> - German sniper hunting rifle. One the
the sweetest features on this weapon is the no cock bolt system.
Its design allows to eject shells without all that twisting and turning,
saving time. The round, 7.62mm is very powerful and is made to kill.
Shoot at any part of the body and its almost certain to destroy its health.
Its up to you which way you want your victim dead!<br><br>
<i>762 Minigun</i> - The only weapon in the CIR arsenal to change your
victim into menced meat within seconds. Pumping out lots of shells
in a short period of time, you have the capacity to kill crowds of
players plus everything else thats in your way. But all this action
comes at a price, you can't jump, run or even walk fast. The when the gun
gets rolling, things get bloody!<br><br>
<a name="#exp"></a><b>Explosive and Handthrown</b><br><br>
<i>35mm Grenade Launcher</i> - The best way to hurl explosive
goodness at your foes is to use this bad-ass weapon. Packing
one large barrel of 35mm grenades, theres no stopping you. Yet,
it comes at a price, it has a heavy recoil which will blow you
back acouple of meters. Fear not! You can deliever 6 contact
greandes at your enemies within 6 seconds. Talk about "Hot and
fresh out of the oven!"<br><br>
<i>C4 explosive</i> - Ever wanted to "blow shit up with style?"
Well, here is your chance. This explosive material is equipped
with two options. A time fuse and remote controlled. The blast
is very powerful and is likely to kill people in its explosion
raduis. Use the option deploy wisely, or you will pay the price.
Be careful, this bomb doesn't know friend from foe!<br><br>

New in Cold Ice Resurrection is the completely rebuilt heads up display.
