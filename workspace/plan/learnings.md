# Learnings

1. An update to Half-Life model viewer v1.24 is Jed's Half-Life Model Viewer v1.36
1. Gimp 2.8 and 2.10 does not export 8-bit bmp files correctly so that Half-Life/Jed's model viewer will import the files.
    Use IrFanView to convert the bmps.
1. MSVC 6 can be run from the [command line](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-6.0/aa699274(v=vs.60)) using the msdev executable.
1. Git submodules are repos within repos. Checkout branch in the submodule folder, commit, and then update the outter repo git commit reference.
1. Continue to reduce the pipeline time to get to test the game changes.
1. Goldsrc requires gcc 4.x to to compile correctly. However, macOS Catalina has removed the header source files for compilation from the xcode toolchain.
1. `user.scr` is for configuration of advanced player options. `settings.scr` is for advanced server options. [Valves wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Non-code_mod_settings) is partially accurate for GoldSrc games.
1. `mapcycle.txt` is used to declare available maps. A map list will appear as soon as one map is added to `maps/` folder in the mod game launch menu.
1. `kb_act.lst` and `kb_def.lst` files coordinate keyboard bindings.
1. Some important [quake tools](https://quakewiki.org/wiki/Quake_tools) that can be useful for pipelining the work.
