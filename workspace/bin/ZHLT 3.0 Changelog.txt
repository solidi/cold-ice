3.4 Final (25 Feb 2006)

Testing is over, and no code changes have been made.

The tools are now safe for use, with 32 Bit, and Windows 64.

PLEASE, note that if you are going to run the 64 Bit tools, with a 32 Bit Operating System, you will get an error box telling you that you 'toolname.exe is not a valid Win32 Applaction'. - http://img517.imageshack.us/my.php?image=untitled1ty.png
