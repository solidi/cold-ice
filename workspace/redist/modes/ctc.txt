The object of 'Catch the Chumtoad' is to hold onto the
chumtoad as long as you can without being fragged by your
friends. You receive 1 point for every 10 seconds you hold
onto the chicken (the time of course is variable). Players
without the chumtoad can only hurt the holder, not each
other or themselves, so you can use big weapons as
recklessly as you like.
