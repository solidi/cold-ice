Jesus is lord and savior with lots of armor and weapons.

Santas must destroy Jesus within a limited amount of time.

Jesus must destroy all Santas.

Jesus wins a point if dispatching all Santas before time is up.

If Jesus survives, the Santa who doles the most damage wins a round.

The round ends in a draw if no damage is doled to Jesus when time is up.
