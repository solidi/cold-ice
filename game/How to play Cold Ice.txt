---How to play Cold Ice---
Its pretty simple. Everyone who joins a cold ice server and starts off with 0 frags. As you frag away with your trusty manual weapon
you can trade in your hard earned frags for some kick ass weapons. You can always buy ammo for a cheap price.

Both of these menu can be actived by the commands   ammomenu  and   weaponmenu

Why did we change the rules?
This was because we wanted to cut lagg. This mode inturn  makes smooth gameplay because the server doesnt have to "slave" all the world models + the serious expolsives.
Also, it gives a chance for the little guy to actually win. A good player will conserve frags inorder to gain the biggest weapons!
But be careful. Dont be a slacky if you have the nuke launcher. People can still kill you.. and they could take away your hard earned weapon!

Dont be a llama! The railgun is probably the best weapon cold ice has to offer. I would USE IT!
