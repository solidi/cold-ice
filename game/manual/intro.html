<p>Cold Ice is a Half-Life Deathmatch that changes all the
weapons from the regular DM and replaces these with totally new
weapons to make the game more enjoyable. It includes first ever
(for HL DM) &quot;Smart Hud Notification System&quot; in which
the client of the HEV is updated with all activities of his or
her own weapons, deaths, other players, items and scoring
points.Cold Ice includes a voice identification system witch both
plays a wav file and displays text to its client on the hud.</p>

Cold Ice?</b></strong></font></p>

<p>Well first off a copy of Half-life by sierra is essential as
without it there's no point even being here. After that make sure
you have the latest version by using the built in upgrade utility
(Currently 1.0.1.0).</p>

<p>We would also suggest the player to own a accelerated cpu, so
it could run at 640X480 resolution. This way its easy to see the
smart hud and the action all at once.</p>

<p>This is a multiplayer only mod, so if you don't have access to
the web for gaming or a network then this also isn't for you
(Wait, how did you get this file then?!?!). </p>

<p>After that simply download the <a
href="http://www.planethalflife.com/dl/dl.asp?planethalflife/coldice/coldice17.zip">zip
file</a> , install the game find a server and you're away.</p>

<p>Finding a server is much easier if you use a shareware tool
such as <a href="http://www.gamespy.com">gamespy</a> which allows
you to filter, monitor and store you're favourite
servers...remember if you use it and you like it then register
it.</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong><b>Great what now?</b></strong></font></p>

<p>Ok so you've connected to a server and everything's fine but
what you really want to know is what you are supposed to be
doing. This is quiet simple. Let me give you some tips.</p>

<p>1) Watch your back at all times.<br>
2) If switching a weapon, do it when alot of expolsions are
occuring, so this way, the enemy cant hear you.<br>
3) Be careful with expolsive weapons (30mm, Grenade Launcher,
Cluster Grenades). Use these weapons only in the open or its
likely you will go down too.<br>
4) If the server is playing a team game, use the voice commands
to inform teammates..(If they are smart enough =)<br>
5) Remember, your well equipped when you respawn, use those
weapons to your advantage.<br>
6) If you want to have a real &quot;blast&quot;, jump into a
crowd with a kamikaze vest on and blow the shit out of yourself
and everyone else! (Its the Best!)</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Great is there anything else I
need to know?</b></font></p>

<p>Nope, thats basically all you need to play Cold Ice and to
play it online.</p>
