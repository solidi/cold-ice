<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Arial">1) If
you are having trouble seeing the action because of the HUD
system , and runnin on a low<br>
resolution, delete the gfx.wad file in the ice folder to decrease
the front size.<br>
2) If you are having trouble with your visuals, cant get the
console to scroll down, or your controls<br>
are screwed up, simply delete the files &quot;config.cfg&quot;
and &quot;settings&quot; files in the ice folder<br>
3) If you are running under software mode for visual, and you
cant see the scoreboard, download<br>
the new </font><a

color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Arial">gfx.wad</font></a><font
color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Arial"> that corrects this
problem. If you still cant see the scoreboard and/or running <br>
a different vis mode, simply bind a key to the command
&quot;+showscores&quot; (Applies to Version 1.6)<br>
4) If you can not start a server because of &quot;map unknown not
found&quot;, simply type &quot;map XXXX&quot;<br>
XXXX would stand for any map you have in the map directory of the
valve folder, or any of the<br>
valve maps.<br>
5) Remember, Cold ice only works with version 1.0.1.0 or higher.
Any lower and the MOD will not<br>
work.<br>
6) MISSING ADPTI, or anything to that effect means that the .dll
is missing (duh!) or is installed in the<br>
wrong directory. The dll should be in the directory of
&quot;dll&quot; in the ice folder.<br>
7) Cold ice is for WIN32 systems only! Theres no consideration
for a linux port.<br>
8) Cold ice should be installed in the directory of
&quot;Half-life&quot; in a folder named &quot;Ice&quot;<br>
9) To make this MOD appear, simply go to the custom game menu and
double click on &quot;Cold Ice&quot;</font></p>
