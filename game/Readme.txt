---Description---
Cold Ice is a Half-Life Deathmatch that changes all the weapons from the regular DM and replaces these with totally new weapons to make the game more enjoyable. It includes first ever (for HL DM) "Smart Hud Notification System" in which the client of the HEV is updated with all activities of his or her own weapons, deaths, other players, items and scoring points.
Cold Ice includes a voice identification system witch both plays a wav file and displays text to its client on the hud.

This MOD is not server sided. You have to have the newest client dll inorder to join  a Ice server.
                                                                                     (Which comes included)


---Installation---
Unzipp Cold Ice into a directory named "ice" under the sierra directory. PLEASE UNZIPP IT INTO "ICE" OR IT SCREWES UP EVERYONE ELSE

---Voice Instruction---
To play sentences for the game half life,  simply type this in the console

say "%!XX_XXXX"

The XX_XXX is from the sentences.txt file in the valves pak file. To play the ones you want just plugin the letters for the sentences.txt to the console.

---Version Confliction---
If you get a message "Wrong DLL" or "Missing DLL", most likely you joined a earlier or newer version of Cold Ice on a server.

---Missing DLL APTI---
This Means the dll and cl_dll  is located in the wrong directory. 
The DLL should always be placed in the C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\ICE\dlls directory.
The CL_DLL should always be placed in the  C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\ICE\cl_dlls directory.
