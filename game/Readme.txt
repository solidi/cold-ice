Cold Ice only runs on version 1010 of half-life or newer.
===================================================


---Description---
Cold Ice is a Half-Life Deathmatch that changes all the weapons from the regular DM and replaces these with totally new weapons to make the game more enjoyable. It includes first ever (for HL DM) "Smart Hud Notification System" in which the client of the HEV is updated with all activities of his or her own weapons, deaths, other players, items and scoring points.
Cold Ice includes a voice identification system witch both plays a wav file and displays text to its client on the hud.

Cold Ice MOD Changes The Following in 1.73:

---Changes---
Off Hand Grapple Hook (Im sorry about the weapon grapple, it wasnt a good idea)
Optimized Smart Hud system allowing the player to see more of the action.
The long jump pack will be replace with a jet pack. (I would like to thank EvilClone for this)
4 new world models. Chaingun, Sniper rifle, Grenade Launcher and Mag60
9 new ammo models
Optimized models in code and pack file.
Fixes a system bug that causes the server to crash if impulse 101 is repeatly activitated
A hud deathnotice fix of inivisible death sprite of train and skull.
Configuration Support for special binds in the menu.
More weapon slots (10)
New version of the iceman model (KICK ASS!)
Voice command doesnt work anymore. (Due to 1.0.1.3 patch)


This MOD is not server sided. You have to have the newest client dll inorder to join  a Ice server.
                                                                                     (Which comes included)


---Installation---
Simply Click on the exe file and it will guide you through the installation process.

---Key Binding---
There are currently 2 commands
1) +hook -  This command lets you throw a grapple hook.
2) +jetpack - If you have the jet pack, this command will let you fly.

---Version Confliction---
If you get a message "Wrong DLL" or "Missing DLL", most likely you joined a earlier or newer version of Cold Ice on a server.

---Missing DLL APTI---
This Means the dll and cl_dll  is located in the wrong directory. 
The DLL should always be placed in the C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\ICE\dlls directory.
The CL_DLL should always be placed in the  C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\ICE\cl_dlls directory.
