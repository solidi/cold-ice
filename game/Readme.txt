v .5 BETA

6/5/99

Cold Ice only runs on version 1010 of half-life or newer.
===================================================

---Description---

Cold Ice is a MOD that changes the appearance of all of the .mdl files into a negative format. Thus leading to a white, blue and pink appearance. Cold ice also changes some the of .wav files for a new and fresh sound to most of the weapons. Some were mixed using Microsoft's recorder program and Creative Wave Studio 4.02. This MOD will have a few  updates or patches because there will be  c++ programming involed. This is so because if you don't have the ice.dll included with the .pak file, you can not join a Cold Ice server. This MOD is based independently on the .pak file where all based files run on Cold Ice and the cl_dll name  "Frozen". Frankly, I didn't intend to make a MOD but because of fooling around with a .mdl viewer, I've decided to develop this MOD. This MOD is only made for the enjoyment of seeing a fresh new look and sound to the awesome game of Half-life.

  -Thanks Valve for blessing us.  :-)
