This MOD is not server sided. You have to have the newest client dll inorder to join  a Ice server.
                                                                                     (Which comes included)


One other note. "Iceman and Icewoman" are models included with this MOD.


---Installation---
Just unzip the files into the C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\ICE directory. Start up the Ice MOD through the Custom Game Menu. And Start up a server and play!


---Voice Instruction---
To play sentences for the game half life,  simply type this in the console

say "%!XX_XXXX"

The XX_XXX is from the sentences.txt file in the valves pak file. To play the ones you want just plugin the letters for the sentences.txt to the console.

---Version Confliction---
If you get a message "Wrong DLL" or "Missing DLL", most likely you joined a earlier or newer version of Cold Ice on a server.

---Missing DLL APTI---
This Means the dll and cl_dll  is located in the wrong directory. 
The DLL should always be placed in the C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\ICE\dlls directory.
The CL_DLL should always be placed in the  C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\ICE\cl_dlls directory.

---Known Buggs---
1) No onwer to the cluster grenades, so its a suicide.
2) 30mm Cannon animation gets stuck when stopped in the middle of firing.
