&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-life advanced is a unique blend of game modes, mutators and 
enhancement to the game <a href="http://half-life.sierra.com/" target="_blank">half-life</a>, developed by <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/" target="_blank">valve</a> from 1996 to 1998. 
Its goal is to deliever renewed interest in half-life
deathmatch. While there are many similar modifications that 
deliever this goal, half-life advanced stands out because it is server sided. Meaning, there 
is no need for a client to download files before joining a server. Half-life advanced is designed to include all of the 
popular game modes such as arena, made popular by the mod <a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/agmod/" target="_blank">AG</a>. It
also includes many unique game modes such as head hunter, freeze-tag
and robo. Half-life advanced also includes a list of mutators that 
can be actived in order to enhance the game play. Such mutators as
anti-camper, earning weapons and boobytrap can really make the gaming
experience intense. Half-life advanced also includes a voting system
where the clients can delegate the role of the server. Clients have the 
option to kick or ban a selected client; can change the map or extend
the current one; and finally change the current game mode and mutators. Half-life
advanced also includes many miscellaneous changes to half-life deathmatch. These enhancements include
nine unique runes, a select amount of weapon power ups and a current weapon
accuracy/kill ratio display for each weapon currently in use. Of course, the admin has the
full ability to disable any addition he or she sees fit for their server. <a href="advanced.html">More.</a><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-life advanced will be executed with extreme professionalism.
For ideas that were not thought of by the author exclusively, full credit will be given.
Half-life advance is a culmination of ideas from past mods as well as unique
ideas from the author. We would like to stress that no money is
earned from the work on this project. We also like to stress the community
to submit new ideas to the author. If the idea is feasible to the half-life source
and makes logical sense, the author will add the brainstorming to the next version of
half-life advanced. We look at it this way, without a community there is 
no reason for us to continue this project. <a href="submition.html">More.</a><br><br></font>
