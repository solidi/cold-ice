&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-life advance is poised to continue it campaign of deathmatch excellence with the release
of half-life 2. Pending on the actual style of half-life 2's deathmatch, half-life advanced will be ported over to its new source.
When this is complete more modifications will be met in order to tweak its structure. From what we heard, half-life 2
will have a similar style of source compared to the original game of half-life. The source is also expected to be in C++, which will
make porting very easy.
