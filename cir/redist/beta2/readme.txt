   | > Introduction.
   ---------------------------------
   Cold-Ice was a modification for the game, Half-Life, two years ago.
   It was a hardcore deathmatch modification intended to change the 
   face of HLDM and its not too popular status. Some people remember
   its glory days, but when it was cancelled over a year ago, enormous
   amounts of players died for another taste of it. Many have asked me 
   to continue the tradition. So, this is where the idea of Cold-Ice 
   Resurrection became something real.

   Cold-Ice Resurrection is the sequeal to Cold-Ice. It is a hardcore 
   deatmatch modification for Half-Life. The basis behind the whole 
   modification is to deliever something fresh and original to the 
   Half-Life community. Something that is not too realistic and something
   that is not too serious. What does it got? It offers many new weapons 
   and gameplay modes never before seen in the original Cold-Ice. Cold-Ice
   Resurrection also has many new and original maps never before seen!
   It also contains a 24-bit hud for sharp, clear display. And something
   that is really cool, we revamped the damage system into a whole new way
   of dying! Die of a heart-attack, brain damage, or just from the bleeding
   after you loose afew limbs! Ready to give it a go? Play it now!
